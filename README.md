We aim to machine learning methods to forecast the Singapore government's bond yields using Macroeconomic factors. These methods will be compared against 2 widely known benchmark models,
AR(1) and random walk models.

We use the interest rates(Bond yields from 3 months to 30 year Bond yield) of Singapore, Japan, United Kingdom and United States, as well as their various macroeconomic factors(Economic Growth, Inflation rate, Depreciation rate,
Equity Returns and Trade Growth) to predict 20 year bond yield of Singapore.
We use various machine learning methods(Best Subset, Forward Stepwise, Backward Stepwise, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net and Artificial Neural Network) to predict. We also used different 
ensembele methods(Gradient Boosting and Random Forest), as well as forecast combinations(Bates-Granger). 

We found that penalised regession methods(Ridge and Lasso) consistently beat the benchmark AR(1) and random walk models.
